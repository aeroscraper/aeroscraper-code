# Stability Pool - End-to-End Flow Documentation

## Overview
The stability pool allows users to stake aUSD stablecoins to earn liquidation gains. When undercollateralized positions are liquidated, the seized collateral is distributed proportionally to all stakers.

## Architecture

### Key Components
1. **StateAccount**: Tracks `total_stake_amount` globally
2. **UserStakeAmount PDA**: Per-user stake tracking (seeds: [b"user_stake_amount", user_pubkey])
3. **TotalLiquidationCollateralGain PDA**: Per-liquidation-event gain tracking (seeds: [b"total_liq_gain", block_height, denom])
4. **Protocol Collateral Vault**: SPL TokenAccount holding seized collateral

### Distribution Model
- **Lazy/Pull-based**: Users withdraw gains when ready (not pushed during liquidation)
- **Proportional**: Share = (user_stake / total_stake) * vault_balance
- **Multi-collateral**: Supports multiple collateral denominations

## End-to-End Flow

### Phase 1: User Stakes aUSD

```
Instruction: stake(amount)
├─ Validates user has sufficient aUSD
├─ Transfers aUSD from user to protocol
├─ Updates UserStakeAmount PDA: user.amount += stake_amount
├─ Updates StateAccount: total_stake_amount += stake_amount
└─ Result: User is now eligible for liquidation gains
```

### Phase 2: Liquidation Occurs

```
Instruction: liquidate_troves([user1, user2, ...], collateral_denom)
├─ For each undercollateralized trove:
│   ├─ Validates ICR < liquidation_ratio
│   ├─ Burns user's debt from protocol vault
│   ├─ Seizes collateral → protocol_collateral_vault
│   └─ Distributes gains to stakers:
│       ├─ Finds TotalLiquidationCollateralGain PDA in remaining_accounts
│       ├─ If found: Updates PDA.amount += seized_amount
│       ├─ If not found: Logs warning, gains stay in vault
│       └─ Emits log: "X denom available for Y stakers to claim"
└─ Result: Seized collateral in vault, ready for stakers to withdraw
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- `distribute_liquidation_gains_to_stakers()` in `trove_management.rs:741-824`
- Expects TotalLiquidationCollateralGain PDAs after 4N trove accounts
- PDA seeds: `[b"total_liq_gain", current_block_height, denom]`
- Handles zero-stake case gracefully (gains wait for stakers)

### Phase 3: User Withdraws Gains

```
Instruction: withdraw_liquidation_gains(collateral_denom)
├─ SECURITY: Validates UserStakeAmount PDA
│   ├─ Derives expected PDA: UserStakeAmount::seeds(&user)
│   ├─ Requires remaining_accounts[0] == expected_pda
│   └─ Rejects with Unauthorized if mismatch (prevents forged stakes)
│
├─ Reads user_stake_amount from validated PDA (offset 8-16)
├─ Reads total_stake from StateAccount
├─ Reads vault_token_balance from protocol_collateral_vault
│   └─ TokenAccount.amount at offset 64-72 (NOT lamports!)
│
├─ Calculates proportional_share:
│   └─ (user_stake / total_stake) * vault_token_balance (u128 math)
│
├─ Validates proportional_share > 0
├─ Transfers SPL tokens from vault → user
├─ Marks UserLiquidationCollateralGain as claimed
└─ Result: User receives their proportional share of liquidation gains
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- `withdraw_liquidation_gains` in `instructions/withdraw_liquidation_gains.rs:63-142`
- Manual deserialization to avoid Rust lifetime conflicts
- Uses checked arithmetic throughout (overflow protection)

## Security Features

### 1. PDA Validation (Critical!)
```rust
let expected_stake_pda = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &UserStakeAmount::seeds(&user_key), 
    &crate::ID
);
require!(
    stake_account_info.key() == expected_stake_pda,
    Unauthorized
);
```
**Why:** Prevents attackers from passing forged stake accounts to drain vault

### 2. Correct Token Balance Reading
```rust
// WRONG: lamports() only returns rent, always ~0
// let balance = vault.lamports();

// CORRECT: Read SPL token amount
let vault_data = vault.try_borrow_data()?;
let amount_bytes = &vault_data[64..72];
let balance = u64::from_le_bytes(amount_bytes);
```
**Why:** Ensures actual collateral balance is used for distribution

### 3. Overflow Protection
- All calculations use `u128` intermediate values
- `checked_mul()` and `checked_div()` prevent overflows
- Reverts on arithmetic errors

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Zero Stakers During Liquidation
```rust
if total_stake == 0 {
    msg!("No stakers, gains remain in protocol vault");
    // Collateral stays in vault until stakers join
}
```

### 2. No Gains Available
```rust
require!(
    proportional_share > 0,
    CollateralRewardsNotFound
);
```

### 3. Missing TotalLiquidationCollateralGain PDA
```rust
if !found {
    msg!("WARNING: Gain PDA not provided - gains tracked in vault only");
    msg!("Stakers can still withdraw proportionally from vault balance");
}
```

## Trade-offs

### Advantages
✅ Simple vault-based distribution
✅ Gas efficient (no per-user updates during liquidation)
✅ Handles multi-collateral seamlessly
✅ No complex lifetime management
✅ Works immediately without extensive PDA management

### Limitations
⚠️ Gains calculated from current vault balance, not historical PDAs
⚠️ Users can't easily query unclaimed gains off-chain
⚠️ No per-liquidation-event attribution (gains are pooled)
⚠️ Proportional share based on current stake, not snapshot at liquidation

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Stake aUSD successfully
- [ ] Liquidate undercollateralized trove with stakers present
- [ ] Verify TotalLiquidationCollateralGain PDA created/updated
- [ ] Withdraw gains with correct proportional share
- [ ] Attempt withdrawal with forged UserStakeAmount PDA (should fail)
- [ ] Liquidate with zero stakers (gains should stay in vault)
- [ ] Multiple stakers withdraw from same liquidation event
- [ ] Verify UserLiquidationCollateralGain prevents double-withdrawal

## Production Readiness
